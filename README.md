## 1st assignment review - chenyy 
Good job on the first assignment! I shall give you a "100" for this assignment. Great reports! BTW, please try to code on yourself as much as possible next time although searching on the internet is an efficient and commendable way. Keep going!

## 2st assignment review - chenyy 
Good job on the first assignment! I shall give you a "92" for this assignment. With a "+2" for your plot the map in Q3.5, a "-5" for your wrong answer in Q3.8 (Hint: 、、`Climatology` of `dayofyear` means to calculate the average of all years for each of the sequential day), and "-5" for no answer in Q3.9 (Hint: `Anomally` means using data of each day of each year minus the average of the sequantial day we calculated on Q3.8). However, please try to avoid or turn off the warnings by searching on the internet, or your reports might be messed up. Hope you can give a perfect report next time. Keep going!
